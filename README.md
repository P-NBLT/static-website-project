# Goal for this project
---

It was important for me to be able to design a system where components could be reused easily at the liking of my "imaginary colleague". Therefore once you know the possible design, or data options that can be applied to a component, anyone can build a website in no time. But it also offer enough flexibility so you can design your own component if the options are not of your liking.
